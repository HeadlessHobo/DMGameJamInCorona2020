            ☐ Options/Settings.
                ☐ Popup
    ☐ Spawn point system.
        ☐ Look at DMSpilJam 2020
    ☐ Look more into Sound manager
    ☐ Refactoring stats system
        ☐ Differentiate stats and other data(Eg. things, we have no need to upgrade or change during the game).
    ☐ Guidelines for importing graphics
    ☐ Guidelines for working together as programmers
    ☐ Importing of previous gamejam scripts.
    ☐ Vision system from DMSpilJam 2020
    ☐ Trigger system
        Take these into account DeathTrigger, WinTrigger and the pickup system
    ☐ Pickup system
        Take trigger system into account.
    ☐ Projectile system
        ☐ Look at previous gamejam(DMSpilJam 2020 as one)
    ☐ Support for different movement types.
        ☐ Platform movement from DMSpilJam 2020
    ☐ Death requirements improvement?
    ☐ Some general debug shortcuts?
    ☐ Grid system
        ☐ Look for a completed one
            Look on the Asset store or the like, if there exists one with high enough quality
        ☐ Create one, if a high quality doesn't exists.
    ☐ Waiting for animation before death more integrated / better support
        Currently have to write too much boilerplate code for it to work.
